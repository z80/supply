This is a firmware whith analyzes "trigger" input on supply board. And if it is tied to ground it initiates DFU firmware.

No, actually it doesn't analyze trigger button. Not it is the following. Regular firmware is located at the very beginning of FLASH. If I displace it never returns from expecting interrupt. So I put it to FLASH start. And regular firmware analyzes trigger at the very beginning itself. And if it is triggered it jumps to FLASH end where DFU is located.
