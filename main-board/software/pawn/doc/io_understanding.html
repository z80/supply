        <h3>IO understanding</h3>
        
        <p>
                Understanding of board to computer data exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data exchange is made very similarly to one used for interaction with various chips. A chip usually have a set of registers. Write to each register is recognized by a chip and implements a particular reaction on this event on its side. Some registers are readable and a chip user is capable to read chip state from its registers.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the board situation is very similar. There is an array of bytes. Both the board and a computer can write elements of this array and read from it. It is implemented as a couple of functions: 
        </p>
        <pre>
            void setId( index, value ), 
            int io( index ).
        </pre>
        <p>
            These functions present on both sides: in board script and in a computer. So interaction is identical from both sides.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no difference if the board is attached to a regular computer through USB or to Raspberry Pi through its extension socket. There is always exactly two interaction functions and they work in one and the same way ragardless of what communication interface is used.

        # Infinite loop with delays.
        while 1:
                # Set 0-th IO array element to be 0
                io.setIo( 0, 0 )
                # Some delay
                sleep( 0.1 )

                # Set 0-th IO array element to be 3
                io.setIo( 0, 3 )
